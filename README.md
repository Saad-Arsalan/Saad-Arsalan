**_`Student | Robotics Enthusiast | FPV Pilot | Web Developer`_**

Iâ€™m a 14-year-old student currently in Grade 9, pursuing International Baccalaureate (IB) program. I'm a robotics enthusiast, FPV pilot, and a learning web developer. I have been diving into building websites, web apps, and even mobile apps using Flutter for the past few months. My robotics journey started with LEGO EV3 and has grown into building high-speed, Arduino-based custom Line Following Robots (LFRs). Iâ€™ve been flying FPV drones for over 2 years, and Iâ€™ve custom-built both FPV racing drones and FPV RC planes. I have hands-on experience with platforms and tools like EV3, Arduino, iNav, Betaflight, BLHeli, and more. My interest in tech spans across both hardware and software, blending creativity with engineering. Iâ€™ve participated in and won multiple robotics and FPV competitions â€” including national-level events â€” and earned prize money for my wins.
